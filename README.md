# PubHub
 I did not write the whole project by myself, it was an project I got of a website. The Goal of the project was to build upon an already created project by adding a tagging system to the site. The Github repository is called PubHub and has two branches, the branch titled master the version without any code that I wrote and the branch that says Updated Version contains the additions I made.
